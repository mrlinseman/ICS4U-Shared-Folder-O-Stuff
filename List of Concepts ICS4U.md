Here is a list of concepts/structures that should be included in your ICS4U Summative Project: 


This list may not be exhaustive. 

**Ask to Add items if you feel I have missed some please**


* Selection: if/else if/ else,  switch statements (**Need all of these**)
* Repetition: do-while,  while, for loops (**Need all of these**)
* Methods:  functions and procedures (**Need all of these**)
* OOP: Conctructor Methods, Instance & Class Mathods, Accessor, Mutator, toString, Equals (**Need all of these**)
* Inheritance: Encapsulation: private, protected, casting (**Need all of these**)
* Recursion: Generally use this to create cool graphics / fractals / etc.  (Quicksort uses recursion but I want more than this - creativity please)
* Sorts:  - quicksort, mergesort, bubble sort, insertion, selection, shell, cocktail-shaker (**You don't need all of these - at least one each group member**)
* Searches - Binary, sequential (**at least one of these each group member**)
* Arrays: 1-D and Multi-dimensional Arrays and Object Arrays (**Need all of these**)
* File I/O: Reading & Writing using JVMs: InputStreamReader, FileReader, FileWriter, PrintWriter, BufferedReader, Scanner (**You don't need to incorporate all of the JVMs, but you need file reading and writing - eg. Scoreboard file, Save files**)
* Error Handling: Both runtime and compilation (**Program must compile to pass** - ideally it won't ever crash)
* Commenting/Documentation (Leave pseudocode and add to it over time - particularly explain difficult structures/algorithms used etc. using comments throughout)

Extras/Enhancements are crucial for better grades:
* Incorporate Humour
* Incorporate Creativity - Vary Rules, Create unique visuals, colour etc.
* Smart use of the above structures that shows insightful use vs. arbitrary addition will also lead to higher grades
* Efficiency & Clarity of code is also going to be a critical factor in my judgement of your project.
* Follow conventions (naming, indentations etc.)
