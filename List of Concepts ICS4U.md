Here is a list of concepts/structures that should be included in your ICS4U Summative Project: 


This list may not be exhaustive. 

**Add items if you feel I have missed some please**


* Selection: if/else if/ else,  switch statements (**Need all of these**)
* Repetition: do-while,  while, for loops (**Need all of these**)
* Methods:  functions and procedures (**Need all of these**)
* OOP: Conctructor Methods, Class Mathods, Accessor, Mutator, toString, Equals, Encapsulation (**Need all of these**)
* Inheritance: Encapsulation: private, protected (**Need all of these**)
* Recursion: Generally use this to create cool graphics / fractals / etc.  (Quicksort uses recursion but I want more than this - creativity please)
* Sorts:  - quicksort, mergesort, bubble sort, insertion, selection, shell, cocktail-shaker (**You don't need all of these - at least 1 each**)
* Searches - Binary, sequential (**at least one of these ea.**)
* Arrays: 1-D and Multi-dimensional Arrays and Object Arrays (**Need all of these**)
* File I/O: Reading & Writing using JVMs: InputStreamReader, FileReader, FileWriter, PrintWriter, BufferedReader, Scanner (**You don't need all of these, but you need file reading and writing - eg. Scoreboard file**)
* Error Handling: Both runtime and compilation (**Program must compile to pass** - Ideally it won't crash ever)
* Commenting/Documentation (Leave pseudocode and add to it over time - particularly explain difficult structures/algorithms used etc. using comments throughout)
